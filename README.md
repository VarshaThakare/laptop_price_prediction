Laptop price prediction:

Problem Statement for Laptop Price Prediction:
We will make a project for Laptop price prediction. The problem statement is that if any user wants to buy a laptop then our application should be compatible to provide a tentative price of laptop according to the user configurations. Although it looks like a simple project or just developing a model, the dataset we have is noisy and needs lots of feature engineering, and preprocessing that will drive your interest in developing this project.

Dataset for Laptop Price Prediction:
Most of the columns in a dataset are noisy and contain lots of information. But with feature engineering you do, you will get more good results. The only problem is we are having less data but we will obtain a good accuracy over it. The only good thing is it is better to have a large data. we will develop a website that could predict a tentative price of a laptop based on user configuration.


Chipotle Exercise:

This is pandas exercise practice. Chipotle dataset contains 5 columns: order_id,	quantity,item_name,choice_description,item_price and contain 17 questions to solve.
